CONFIGURE YOUR WEBSERVER
=========================
Use the directory 'public' as the webroot directory and allow PHP execution. If you use the Hiawatha webserver, you can use the following UrlToolkit configuration:

UrlToolkit {
	ToolkitID = banshee
	RequestURI isfile Return
	Match ^/(css|files|images|js)($|/) Return
	Match ^/(favicon.ico|robots.txt)$ Return
	Match .*\?(.*) Rewrite /index.php?$1
	Match .* Rewrite /index.php
}

For Apache, there is a .htaccess file in the 'public' directory which contains the URL rewriting rules.


CONFIGURE PHP
==============
Banshee needs PHP's MySQL and XSL module. Use the following PHP settings:
	cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0 (when using FastCGI PHP), 1 (otherwise)
	cgi.rfc2616_headers = 1 (when using Hiawatha), 0 (when using Apache)
	register_globals = Off
	allow_url_include = Off


CONFIGURE YOUR DATABASE
========================
Change the database settings in 'settings/website.conf' and run the script 'database/setup_database'. This will create a MySQL user, a MySQL database and initialize the created database.

The installed database already contains two users: 'admin' and 'user'. Both have the password 'banshee'.


CONFIGURE BANSHEE

Go to the Settings page in the CMS and replace the present e-mail addresses with your own.
